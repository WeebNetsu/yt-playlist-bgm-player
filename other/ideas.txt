Add new way to parse flags with TCLAP (http://tclap.sourceforge.net/manual.html#EXAMPLE)

bgmplayer -add:nameOfPlaylist playlistLink -> add playlist in one line
bgmplayer -delete:nameOfPlaylist -> delete playlist in one line
bgmplayer -deletenum:playlistNumber -> delete playlist via it's number given to it
bgmplayer -single:[link] -> play single link and don't save it as playlist
bgmplayer -video -> enable video
bgmplayer --help -> display a list of usable flags
bgmplayer -random -> choose a random playlist and play it

(users should have accounts and this will use accounts)
[Use auth, this directs the user to a website they can sign up on, and login with]
[Once they logged in bgmplayer will detect it and store their login details to use when they want to upload]
bgmplayer --backup -> upload playlist file to the internet 
bgmplayer --restore -> download backed up playlist file

Add flags list to help text
Allow user to add custom path to custom.txt file

FIX: Editing Playlists is still buggy!
