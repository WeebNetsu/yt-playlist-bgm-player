bgmplayer ideas:
REFRACTOR THE CODE!
bgmplayer -add:nameOfPlaylist playlistLink -> add playlist in one line
bgmplayer -delete:nameOfPlaylist -> delete playlist in one line
bgmplayer -deletenum:playlistNumber -> delete playlist via it's number given to it
bgmplayer -single:[link] -> play single link and don't save it as playlist
bgmplayer -video -> enable video
bgmplayer --flags -> display a list of usable flags
bgmplayer -random -> choose a random playlist and play it
bgmplayer -download:[link] -> download from link using yt-dlc

(users should have accounts and this will use accounts)
[Use auth, this directs the user to a website they can sign up on, and login with]
[Once they logged in bgmplayer will detect it and store their login details to use when they want to upload]
bgmplayer --backup -> upload playlist file to the internet 
bgmplayer --restore -> download backed up playlist file

Add silent flag to output so mpv does not display so much data
Add flags list to help text
Update readme to say this is just a frontend for mpv
Update github to say this is just a frontend for mpv
